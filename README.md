# ReactWeatherApp

This app uses the OpenWeather API and ZipCodeBase API to deliver local weather information based on postal code.

It is built using React and vanilla Javascript.

Currently only US postal codes are compatible with the app. Check back soon for international support!

All code written by Leo Westebbe.
